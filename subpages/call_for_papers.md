## Scope and Topics

The theme of this edition is the interplay between **microservices** and the **Digital Transformation**, i.e., the process of accelerating and improving business activities, processes, and models through digital automation. This process is crucial for companies in highly-competing markets, where integration and flexibility of software systems becomes a critical asset to establish leadership. Here, microservices can play a central role. They can streamline integration (thanks to their focus on standards and interoperability) and enable more flexible solutions (by supporting dynamic deployments and elastic scaling). 

However these benefits come at a cost: an increased complexity that calls for a proportional improvement of techniques for software construction. This requires contributions from different areas, ranging from formal methods to software engineering and the general art of programming.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Design and implementation of microservice architectures.
- Empirical studies of microservices.
- Software engineering methods for microservices.
- Security in microservices.
- Formal models for microservices.
- Verification (both static and runtime) of microservice systems.
- Programming languages and techniques for microservices.
- Testing for microservices.

We solicit contributed talks based work in progress, scientific work published or submitted for publication, or practical experience reports.
Authors wishing to present their work are invited to submit extended abstracts following the <a onclick="$('#submission_tab a').trigger('click'); return false;" href="#submission">submission guidelines</a>.
Abstracts and presentations must be in English.

## Post-proceedings
Depending on the success of this initiative, we are considering the publication of a volume of post-proceedings, for which there will be a separate call for papers.
In this way, the interested authors will have a chance to enrich their contributions according to the feedback they received during the event.
The tentative deadline for submitting papers for the post-proceedings is mid-May 2019.

Please contact the [chairs](/committees) if you have questions.
