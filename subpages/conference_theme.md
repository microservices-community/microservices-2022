### Microservices in the Age of Digital Transformation

The general theme of Microservices 2022 is the aspects of microservices in the age of digital transformation.

- On the one hand, the adoption of microservices is fostering the adoption of new architectural patterns and software construction practices; understanding the security properties (or the emerging vulnerabilities) of the resulting constructs calls for the development of a fresh mindset in analysts, designers and testers alike. In addition, the additional middleware and infrastructure typically proposed for the management of microservice-based architectures could expand the attack surface of the systems.
- On the other hand, microservices are often adopted as an accelerator of digital transformations. Some of the opportunities in microservices involve the development of sustainable practices, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and new architectures and technologies. In this light, addressing the complexity of digital transformation should be a primary concern for microservices researchers and practitioners, while improving/enhancing microservices principles, patterns, architectures, security, and technologies.

Microservices welcomes both theoretical and experimental submissions on topics ranging from formal frameworks to industrial experience reports and demonstrations. Presentations will be selected based on abstract submissions of maximum two pages. See the call for papers for details.
