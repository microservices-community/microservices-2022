The conference's overarching aim is to bring together industry and academia, to foster discussion on practice and research of microservices. 

Microservices 2022 is part of a conference series started with [Microservices 2017](https://www.conf-micro.services/2017/index.html) which successfully brought together many international practitioners and researches interested in the software paradigm of microservices.
