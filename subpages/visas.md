Permanent residents of the countries of the Schengen area are exempt from a visa to visit France. Other countries, such as United States of America or Canada, have bilateral agreements allowing their citizens to visit France without visas. Other visitors may require a short-stay visa. For more information, visit the [France Diplomacy] (https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/) website or check with a local French consulate about visa requirements for your country of residence and/or nationality.
