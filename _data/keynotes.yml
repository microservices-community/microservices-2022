  title: Technical Debt and Microservices
  affiliation: University of Oulu, Finland
  abstract: |
    The Microservice paradigm is being adopted more and more in industry to support the agility of empowered development teams. However, developing or migrating to microservices is no easy task. The risk of failure is to incur in a large Architectural Technical Debt and, consequently, in costly consequences for the organizations. Agile software development and Continuous Architecting might help to mitigate the negative impact of such Architectural Debt by monitoring its accumulation in a Microservice architecture.

    Dr. Valentina Lenarduzzi is an assistant professor (tenure track) at University of Oulu (Finland) and docent at LUT University, Finland. Her research activities are related to modern software development practices and methodologies, including data analysis in software engineering, software quality, software maintenance and evolution, focusing on Technical Debt as well as code and architectural smells. She got the Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2015 and was a postdoctoral researcher at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, (Italy), at the Tampere University (Finland), and at LUT University (Finland). Moreover, she was visiting researcher at the University of Kaiserslautern (TUK) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering IESE (Germany). She served as a program committee member of various international conferences (e.g., ICPC, ICSME, ESEM), and for various international journals (e.g., TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST) in the field of software engineering. She has been program co-chair of OSS 2021 and TechDebt 2022.  She was also one of the organizer of the last edition of MaLTeSQuE workshop (2022) collocated with ESEC/FSE.  Dr. Lenarduzzi is recognized by the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS) as one of the most active SE researcher in top-quality journals in the period 2013 to 2020.

    Fabio Casati is a Principal Machine Learning Architect and
    Engineer at Servicenow.<br>

    Fabio focuses on designing, architecting and deploying AI-powered
    workflows for enterprise customers. On the research side, he is
    working on AI applied to workflows and on quality in AI. Previously he
    was Professor at the University of Trento. In that role, he started
    research lines on crowdsourcing and hybrid human-machine computations,
    focusing on applications that have direct positive impact on society
    through tangible artefacts adopted by the community. Prior to that, he
    was technical lead for the research program on business process
    intelligence in Hewlett-Packard USA, where he contributed to several
    HP commercial products in the area of web services and business
    process management. He co-authored a best-selling book on Web services
    and is author of over 250 peer-reviewed papers.
  title: Crossing the Chasm Between AI Services and AI-powered Workflows
  abstract: |
    Companies are devoting significant effort -and budget- into powering 
    their processes with AI. Despite the strong push by both AI customers 
    (the enterprise) and providers of AI services and technology, 
    the journey to AI is often not simple -or not as simple as expected at 
    first- and the benefits are hard to assess. This is surprising to many, 
    given the amazing success that AI seems to have on all sorts of domains, 
    where super-human performance is reported in many tasks seemingly related 
    to what AI is asked to do in the enterprise.
    In this talk I will present some of the reasons for the disconnect between 
    the (perceived) quality of AI services on one side, and the transformational 
    impact they can have on AI-powered enterprise processes on the other. 
    I will focus specifically on two key problems that limit adoption of AI 
    services today. The first is that the way we measure and communicate the quality 
    of AI services is fundamentally wrong, and this leads to wrong process design 
    decisions and to an improper use of AI in business processes. 
    The second is that AI service and technology providers often focus on the benefits 
    of AI services once in production, but underestimate the importance of simplifying 
    the journey that process owners have to follow to get there. 
    I will present concrete examples of both issues, and show (i) how we can rethink 
    the notion of AI quality in enterprise processes and (ii) how AI can simplify 
    its own journey to adoption, thereby helping AI services to cross the adoption chasm.

    Process Management, and API visualization are available on LeanPub.
  title: The Microservice Hypothesis
  abstract: |
    Microservice architectures are based on the hypothesis that by keeping 
    components small, this can foster their autonomy and independent evolution. 
    Microservices reframed the modularity issue as a decomposition problem, 
    where APIs are introduced to reconnect separately deployed components. 
    In this talk we will explore a large collection of real-world APIs looking 
    for patterns attempting to illustrate the relationship between size and 
    coupling, both in space and time.
