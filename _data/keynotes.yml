   title: Technical Debt and Microservices
   affiliation: University of Oulu, Finland
   abstract: |
     The Microservice paradigm is being adopted more and more in industry to support 
     the agility of empowered development teams. However, developing or migrating to 
     microservices is no easy task. The risk of failure is to incur in a large 
     Architectural Technical Debt and, consequently, in costly consequences for the 
     organizations. Agile software development and Continuous Architecting might 
     help to  mitigate the negative impact of such Architectural Debt by monitoring 
     its accumulation in a Microservice architecture.
